*Overview of Group based Peer-to-Peer file sharing system*
- Multiple Trackers behind a load balancer (for fault tolerance and load balancing)
- Data abstraction layer (containing user management data and files metadata)
- Peers: interface for users to share data with in their groups

### Peer-to-Peer communication steps
- User login to a peer and queries tracker for files available and gets their metadata containing the seeders list
- Requests the seeders to send the piece information
- Apply piece selection algorithm to optimize the data transfer between peers
- Actual file data transfer in pieces
- Notify tracker to add as seeder once the piece is available.

#### Integration aspects:
##### Internal APIs as part of Download scenario
- get_file_info -> API to get file information from tracker
- get_piece_info -> API to get piece information from the seeder
- download_piece -> API to download a particular piece
- update_seeders_list -> Update seeders list after piece is downloaded
- update_status -> update download status
